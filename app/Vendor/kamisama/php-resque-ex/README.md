Php-Resque-ex: Resque for PHP [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kamisama/php-resque-ex.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kamisama/php-resque-ex)
===========================================

Resque is a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing
those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.

## Background ##

Php-Resque-Ex is a fork of [php-resque](https://github.com/chrisboulton/php-resque) by chrisboulton. See the [original README](https://github.com/chrisboulton/php-resque/blob/master/README.md) for more informations.

## Additional features ##

This fork provides some additional features :

### Support of php-redis

Autodetect and use [phpredis](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) to connect to Redis if available. Redisent is used as fallback.

### Powerfull logging

Instead of piping STDOUT output to a file, you can log directly to a database, or send them elsewhere via a socket. We use [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) to manage all the logging. See their documentation to see all the available handlers.

Log infos are augmented with more informations, and associated with a workers, a queue, and a job ID if any.

### Job creation delegation

If Resque_Job_Creator class exists and is found by Resque, all jobs creation will be delegated to this class.

The best way to inject this class is to include it in you `APP_INCLUDE` file.

Class content is :

```php
class Resque_Job_Creator
{
	public static function createJob($className, $args) {

		// $className is you job class name, the second arguments when enqueuing a job
		// $args are the arguments passed to your jobs

		// Instanciate your class, and return the instance

		return new $className();
	}
}
```

This is pretty useful when your autoloader can not load the class, like when classname doesn't match its filename. Some framework, like CakePHP, uses `PluginName.ClassName` convention for classname, and require special handling before loading.

### Failed jobs logs

You can easily retrieve logs for a failed jobs in the redis database, their keys are named after their job ID. Each failed log will expire after 2 weeks to save space.

### Command Line tool

Fresque is shipped by default to manage your workers. See [Fresque Documentation](https://github.com/kamisama/Fresque) for usage.

## Installation

Clone the git repo

	$ git clone git://github.com/kamisama/php-resque-ex.git

 `cd` into the folder you just cloned

	$ cd ./php-resque-ex

Download Composer

	$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install dependencies

	$ php composer.phar install

## Usage

### Logging

Use the same way as the original port, with additional ENV :

* `LOGHANDLER` : Specify the handler to use for logging (File, MongoDB, Socket, etc â€¦).
 See [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog#handlers) doc for all available handlers.
`LOGHANDLER` is the name of the handler, without the "Handler" part. To use CubeHandler, just type "Cube".
* `LOGHANDLERTARGET` : Information used by the handler to connect to the database.
Depends on the type of loghandler. If it's the *RotatingFileHandler*, the target will be the filename. If it's CubeHandler, target will be a udp address. Refer to each Handler to see what type of argument their `__construct()` method requires.
* `LOGGING` : This environment variable must be set in order to enable logging via Monolog. i.e `LOGGING=1`

If one of these two environement variable is missing, it will default to *RotatingFile* Handler.

### Redis backend

* `REDIS_BACKEND` : hostname of your Redis database
* `REDIS_DATABASE` : To select another redis database (default 0)
* `REDIS_NAMESPACE` : To set a different namespace for the keys (default to *resque*)
* `REDIS_PASSWORD` : If your Redis backend needs authentication

## Requirements ##

* PHP 5.3+
* Redis 2.2+
